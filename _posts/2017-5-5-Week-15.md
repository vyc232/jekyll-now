## Last Post

The class is over!! We just finished taking the exam and it was easier than I expected. I think the whole class agrees as well due to the number of people that finished early. It was definitely easier than the first exam, however it may be because I studied more. Overall the class was fairly enjoyable. I was lucky enough to have a fantastic group to work with. Everyone was so hardworking and we all worked really hard to make sure other group members didn't have much to do. I really learned a lot of useful material in the class and feel more prepared due to the exposure of the tools we were required to learn. However, the only thing I didn't really enjoy or find useful was learning XML. It seems like it was just thrown in there for a lecture and I personally didn't see that much benefit in learning it. That's not to say it's not useful or that I didn't learn XML. I just don't think the topic was a good fit for the class. Something that could've been better about the course is how split up it seemed. It felt like we spent a lot of time learning about Python intricacies, then went straight into learning about software engineering principles. Obviously I'm not sure what the department requires for the course, but it seemed like the Python lessons didn't have anything to do with "Software Engineering". But! It was still a worthwhile class and very fulfilling to be able to create something from scratch with a group of friends.
